## History
At this point we are just creating functions to move one step
as well as som utility functions to print out the location: contents/coordinates

## Next Steps
Create a better defaults for testing...
Ideally I'd probably want to update the defaults to [0,0]
For the time being I'll have it set for testing.

## Need to implement recursion
I imagine the function ends when we are no longer lost.. when E is found

```js
function mazeFinder(param1, param2) {
  if(currentLocationContents === "e") {
    lost = false
    return out of the recursive function
  }

  continue recursion;

}
```
